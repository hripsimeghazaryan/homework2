		<h2> Development </h2>
		<h3>Films</h3>
		
		<p>By 2005, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Entertainment">Marvel Entertainment</a> began planning to independently produce its own films and distribute them through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. Previously, Marvel had co-produced several superhero films with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Line_Cinema">New Line Cinema</a> and others, including a seven-year development deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox">20th Century Fox</a>. Marvel made relatively little profit from its licensing deals with other studios and wanted to get more money out of its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution. Avi Arad, head of Marvel's film division, was pleased with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films at Sony, but was less pleased about others. As a result, they decided to form Marvel Studios, Hollywood's first major independent movie studio since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a>. <br /><br />Arad's second-in-command, Kevin Feige, realized that unlike Spider-Man and the X-Men, whose film rights were licensed to Sony and Fox, respectively, Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers. Marvel's plan was to release individual films for their main characters and then merge them in a crossover film.<br /><br /> Feige initially referred to the shared narrative continuity of these films as the Marvel Cinema Universe, but later used the term Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel has designated the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Earth-199999 within the continuity of the company's multiverse, a collection of fictional alternate universes. </p>

		<h3>Distributors</h3>
		<p>Over time, the distribution rights to Marvel Studios' films changed hands on multiple occasions. In November 2006, Universal Pictures announced that it would distribute The Incredible Hulk, in an arrangement separate from Marvel's 2005 deal with Paramount, which was distributing Marvel's other films. In September 2008, after the international success of Iron Man, Paramount signed a deal to have worldwide distribution rights for Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, and Marvel's The Avengers. In late December 2009, The Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. Disney has distributed all subsequent Marvel Studios films. In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger from Paramount. In February 2015, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures">Sony Pictures Entertainment</a> and Marvel Studios announced a licensing deal that would allow Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the character first appearing in Captain America: Civil War.</p>
